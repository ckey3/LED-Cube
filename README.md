# LED-Cube

# Overview

I was originally creating a 4x4x4 led cube but ended up creating a 4x4 led surface. It was going to have 64 LEDs soldered together in the form of a 4x4x4 cube, lit by a Raspberry pi pico but ended up being 16 lights soldered together. The cube shown in the video is powered by an Arduino Nano but I used a Raspberry Pi Pico. This surface allows me to do two-dimensional light patterns. Using circuitpython.
